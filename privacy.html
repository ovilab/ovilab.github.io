Your privacy is critically important to us. At Ovilab, we have a few fundamental principles:

<ul>
 	<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
 	<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
 	<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals. (Note: we’ve based much of this privacy policy on the privacy policies of Automattic.com and Creative Commons. Neither Automattic.com nor Creative Commons are affiliated with Ovilab. This privacy policy is shared under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons ShareAlike</a> license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and we’re sure Automattic.com and Creative Commons would appreciate a link to Automattic.com and CreativeCommons.org somewhere on your site. They spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same. However, please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy may not be completely
suitable for your situation. Ovilab strongly encourages you to seek the advice of your own attorney before repurposing this Privacy Policy on your own site.)

<h2>Preamble</h2>
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection, use, and disclosure of “personal information” by Ovilab. Unless otherwise noted on a particular site or service, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of all websites that Ovilab operates, including <a href="http://creativecommons.org">http://ovilab.net</a>, (the “Ovilab Website”), (collectively, the “Websites”), as well as the products, information, and services provided by Ovilab, including software applications (together with the Websites, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the Services operated by affiliates of Ovilab.

In addition, supplemental Privacy Policy terms (“Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms”) may apply to a particular Service. All such Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that particular Service.

As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number, or email address.

By accessing or using any of the Services, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
Like most website operators, Ovilab collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ovilab’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ovilab’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Ovilab may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Ovilab also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Ovilab's websites. Ovilab only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
Certain users of Ovilab’s Services choose to interact with Ovilab in ways that require Ovilab to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ovilab gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Ovilab collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction with Ovilab. Ovilab does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
Ovilab may collect statistics about the behavior of users of its Services. Ovilab may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Ovilab does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
<h2>Participating in Our Community</h2>
Registered Users. When you register to obtain a user account on any of the Services (any such person, a “Registered User”), you may be asked to provide personal information to create your account and establish a password and profile. We encourage you to
use an alias or nickname if you are not comfortable providing your legal name. The name or nickname you provide in connection with your account may be used to attribute you in connection with any content you submit to any Service. We also use that personal information to establish and maintain your account, to provide you with the features
we provide Registered Users, and to email you regarding changes to this policy or other applicable policies. If you sign up to receive updates from Ovilab when you create your account, we will use your personal information to send you communications about Ovilab news and campaigns.
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
Ovilab discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ovilab’s behalf or to provide services available at Ovilab’s Websites and Services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ovilab’s Websites and Services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ovilab will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ovilab discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ovilab believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ovilab, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Ovilab Website or Service and have supplied your email address, Ovilab may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ovilab and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ovilab takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. However, no Website or Service can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We will post a reasonably prominent notice to the Websites if any such security breach occurs.
<h2>Cookies</h2>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ovilab uses cookies to help Ovilab identify and track visitors, their usage of Ovilab Websites, and their Website access preferences. Ovilab visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ovilab’s Websites, with the drawback that certain features of Ovilab’s Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
If Ovilab, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Ovilab goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Ovilab may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
<h2>Ads</h2>
Ads appearing on any of our Websites or Services may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Ovilab and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
<h2>Children</h2>
The Services are not directed at children under the age of 13. We will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. We prohibit anyone using our Services from submitting any personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to Ovilab through the Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.
<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
The Services may include links to other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.
<h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>
The Services are primarily hosted in Norway, the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. Please note that your personal data may be located on servers outside of your home country, including, but not limited to, locations in Norway, the United States, the European Union, and/or the United Kingdom. By providing your personal data you consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
