We are happy to announce that Neuronify 1.2 is now available for Linux,
macOS and Windows.
Neuronify is an educational app where you can explore how neurons and
neural networks behave.
You can use it to build synaptic connections between neurons and explore 
how changes in single cells lead to behavioral changes in entire networks.

This release brings a visual overhaul of Neuronify, in addition to many
features requested by our users.
The new design is implemented with desktop users in mind and makes it 
easier to use Neuronify for teachers who want to develop a set of
simulations for students.

[Download Neuronify 1.2](http://ovilab.net/neuronify)

This release is available as a Snap package on Ubuntu,
as a downloadable installer on Windows and a .dmg file on macOS.
It will also be published in Windows Store and 
Mac App Store in the coming days.

# What is in the new release #

The creation menu is now always visible and makes the most common items,
such as the leaky neurons, the voltmeter and DC generator always visible.
You can either drag one of these directly onto the canvas or select it
to see other items in the same category:

Adjusting the potentials of leaky neurons now shows a preview of the
behavior of the neuron, making it easier to visualize:

The opreations for undo, redo, cut, copy, paste and delete are now available from the
top toolbar:

Saving and loading simulations can now be done to .neuronify files that 
contain the simulation, a name, description and screenshot.
These can be shared with others by traditional means of file sharing or e-mail:

Further, a community menu shows hosted simulations that can be downloaded.
These are shared by other Neuronify users, which is a feature we think can be
very attrative for teachers who wish to share their simulations with students.

Contact us if you are interested in sharing your simulations in the
community menu.
You find our contact information on the bottom of this page.

# What about mobile users? #

The new features and design will be brought to mobile users in a later
release.
The new design first needs to be adapted back to mobile devices by for 
instance hiding the creation menu and the toolbar on small screens.
Further, all the new features need to be thoroughly tested on touch
devices to make sure they work as expected.
We also have a number of new features, 
such as short and long term plasticity and multicompartmental models,
that have been requested by our users. 
Work on these features may delay the release of the new design to 
mobile devices somewhat.
