We are happy to announce that Neuronify 1.3 is now available for Linux,
macOS and Windows.
Neuronify is an educational app where you can explore how neurons and
neural networks behave.

The latest release includes a number of bugfixes and includes an updated
community feature which now used Firebase as a backend.
The community feature released in Neuronify 1.2 was unfortunately limited,
but with the new backend, we expect the community feature to be much more
suitable for Neuronify users.
